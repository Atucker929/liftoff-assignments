# The Fast-Life - A Lifestyle Blog on Intermittent Fasting and Natural Living 

# Overview

In 2015 when I started experiancing daily migraines that effected my normal activities and modern medicine was not helping I stumbled upon the natural living community. I am strong believer in self healing and have practiced Intermittent Fasting for several years now. For people who are new to Intermittant Fasting and Natural Living the transition to this lifestyle can be difficult and lonely. The Fast-Life Blog will help to bring together a community of like minded individuals who can read and comment on blog posts, view recipes and support one another on their natural living journey. 

Users who have created an account would be able to comment on posts, search posts by keyword, read recipes and will have access to a printable calendar to help them to get started.
